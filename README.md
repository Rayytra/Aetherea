## FAQ
### > **Project Lead**
This project is currently led and maintained by **Rayy** </br>

### > **Why?**
It was hard for me to animate/composite on linux. </br>
And because i don't like switching applications and rearranging just to composite.

Performance.

### > **Backend?**
Currently wgpu for 2D. Written manually.</br>
Looking forward to 3D sometime in the future.
